It's finally happening. We've discussed many times, but now we're making it a reality in the twilight of our youth.

My brother, my twin cousins, one twin's husband, and I have planned for a good portion of the year to take a weeklong trip to Orlando, Florida.
The married twin worked with her university's Disney program and spent months at Walt Disney World.
  With her as our guide, we made all the preparations.
  Despite constant discussion and planning, we ended up doing an awful lot of packing at the last minute.
  
We will be attending all four parks: "The Magic Kingdom", "Animal Kingdom", "Hollywood Stuidos", and "EPCOT".
